Project Overview:

This data science project leverages Python to develop two complementary models:

1. Anomaly Detection in Voting Patterns: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify outliers in voting data, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.
2. Flood Prediction Model: A predictive model that forecasts flood events based on rainfall data, providing early warnings for timely interventions.

Objectives:

- Develop a robust anomaly detection model to identify unusual voting patterns
- Create a predictive model to forecast flood events with high accuracy
- Utilize Python libraries and frameworks to ensure efficiency and scalability
- Validate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations

Deliverables:

- A functional anomaly detection model for voting patterns
- A flood prediction model with high accuracy
- Comprehensive documentation and presentation of project findings
- Python code repository for future development and deployment

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to address critical issues in voting integrity and natural disaster preparedness.
